# Opal

Opal is a Solana-native optimistic oracle for verifying real-world statements written in natural language. It is designed for statements that price feeds, APIs, and deterministic onchain data cannot safely answer on their own.

The first target use case is prediction-market resolution. A market or application can ask Opal to resolve statements like:

```text
Kanye West's Delhi concert got postponed.
```

Assertions are treated as true by default during a liveness window. If nobody disputes the statement, it finalizes as `True`. If someone disputes it, they post collateral and the statement moves through Opal's resolution flow.

## How It Works

1. An asserter submits a natural-language statement and posts a PUSD bond.
2. The assertion enters `Asserted`, where the default optimistic answer is `True`.
3. If no one disputes before the liveness window expires, the assertion finalizes as `Resolved(True)`.
4. If the assertion is disputed, the first dispute creates an `LLMResolutionRound`.
5. The v1 LLM resolver uses Switchboard On-Demand/Oracle Quotes to post a proposed outcome.
6. If the LLM result is not challenged, it becomes the final outcome.
7. If the LLM result is challenged, the assertion escalates to OPAL-weighted private voting through MagicBlock.
8. Once voting settles, the assertion becomes `Resolved` and consumers can safely read `AssertionAccount.outcome`.

## Resolution Outcomes

Opal supports four outcomes:

- `True` - the statement is verified as correct.
- `False` - the statement is verified as incorrect.
- `TooEarly` - the statement cannot be resolved yet because the relevant real-world truth does not exist or has not been published at resolution time.
- `Unresolvable` - the statement cannot be safely resolved from available evidence, auxiliary data, or voting consensus.

## Protocol Shape

Opal uses separate accounts for the main assertion, first dispute, second dispute, LLM resolution, and vote resolution:

- `AssertionAccount`
- `LLMDisputeAccount`
- `VoteDisputeAccount`
- `LLMResolutionRound`
- `VoteResolutionRound`
- `VoteRecord`
- `BondVault`
- `ProtocolConfig`
- `Treasury`

The assertion stores the statement, an `auxiliary_hash` pointing to offchain resolution guidance, lifecycle state, dispute pointers, resolution round pointers, and final outcome. It does not store the full auxiliary data or a tentative-resolution field.

## Economic Model

- PUSD is used for assertion bonds, dispute bonds, slashing, rewards, and treasury fees.
- OPAL is used for voting weight, governance/config control, and voter incentives.
- The first dispute challenges the default optimistic `True` answer.
- The second dispute challenges the LLM result.
- Vote influence is intended to use time-weighted average voting: `locked_opal * time_weight`.

## External Systems

Opal currently assumes these integrations:

- Switchboard On-Demand/Oracle Quotes for the v1 LLM resolution path.
- MagicBlock Private Ephemeral Rollups for private OPAL voting.
- MagicBlock Private Payments API as optional OPAL custody plumbing, not as the vote-casting mechanism itself.
- Nosana and/or an LLM Council as future resolver-hardening paths.

## Documentation

The main design docs live in `docs/`:

- [Glossary](docs/glossary.md) - shared vocabulary and protocol terms.
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) - account model, state machine, instruction flow, and integration boundaries.
- [Resolution](docs/resolution.md) - how statements move from assertion to final outcome.
- [Tokenomics](docs/tokenomics.md) - PUSD collateral, OPAL voting, dispute correctness, rewards, and slashing.

## Repository Status

This repository is currently in the documentation and protocol-design stage. Program code, clients, tests, and deployment tooling are not yet finalized.

## Building

Placeholder. Build instructions will be added once the Solana program and client workspace are scaffolded.

Expected future sections:

- Solana/Anchor program build
- TypeScript client build
- Generated SDK/client build

## Testing

Placeholder. Test instructions will be added once implementation begins.

Expected future coverage:

- State transition tests
- Dispute correctness tests
- Switchboard result verification tests
- MagicBlock voting/delegation tests
- Token settlement and slashing tests

## Local Development

Placeholder. Local development instructions will be added with the first implementation scaffold.

Expected future requirements:

- Solana CLI
- Anchor
- Node.js or Bun
- Switchboard SDK
- MagicBlock Ephemeral Rollups SDK

## Deployment

Placeholder. Deployment instructions and network addresses will be added when devnet/mainnet targets are chosen.

Expected future sections:

- Program deployment
- Protocol config initialization
- Treasury setup
- Switchboard feed setup
- MagicBlock validator/endpoint configuration

## Security

Placeholder. Security policy and audit notes will be added before production deployment.

Areas that need review:

- Bond and slashing economics
- Switchboard feed identity and staleness verification
- MagicBlock delegated-state lifecycle
- OPAL voting concentration and manipulation resistance
- Integrator finality guarantees

## License

Placeholder. License has not been selected yet.
