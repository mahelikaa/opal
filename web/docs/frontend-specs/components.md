# Components

Inventory of `web/components/`, grouped by folder. "Client" = has `'use client'`.
Purely presentational wrappers omit the directive and rely on being rendered inside a
client tree.

## `ui/` — design-system primitives (shadcn `base-nova` over `@base-ui/react`)

| File | Exports | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `button.tsx` | `Button`, `buttonVariants` | `cva` with `variant` (default/outline/secondary/ghost/destructive/link) and `size` (default/xs/sm/md/lg/icon/icon-xs/icon-sm/icon-lg). House style baked into the base: `rounded-none tracking-wider uppercase`. `default` = solid lime (no glow) + a diagonal shine sweep on hover; `outline`/`destructive` = **borderless tinted fills** (`bg-primary/10 text-primary` / `bg-destructive/15 text-destructive`) that deepen on hover (dashed borders are reserved for framing, not interactive controls). `data-slot="button"`. Wraps `@base-ui/react/button`. When rendering as a link use `nativeButton={false}` + `render={<Link/>}`. |
| `input.tsx` | `Input` | `h-12`, transparent bg, `rounded-none` solid border, lime focus ring. Wraps Base UI input. |
| `textarea.tsx` | `Textarea` | Native `<textarea>`, `field-sizing-content`, `resize-none`, `no-scrollbar`. |
| `kbd.tsx` | `Kbd`, `KbdGroup` | Keyboard-shortcut chips. |
| `select.tsx` | `Select` + `SelectGroup/Value/Trigger/Content/Label/Item/Separator` | Client. Wraps `@base-ui/react/select` with Portal/Positioner/Popup, animation data-attrs. `SelectTrigger` has manual `size` prop via `data-size` (not cva). |
| `input-group.tsx` | `InputGroup`, `InputGroupAddon/Button/Text/Input/Textarea` | Client. Most elaborate `cva` usage; composable input-with-addons. Currently **not consumed** elsewhere. |

The primary accent color is a vivid **lime/chartreuse**; expect `text-primary` and lime
highlights throughout.

## `assertion/`

| File | Export | Client | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `assertion-card.tsx` | `AssertionCard` | ✅ | Feed card; links to detail; live 1s countdown; color-codes finalization; shows voting weight when `> 0n`. Props `{ data: AssertionAccount }`. |
| `voting-panel.tsx` ⭐ new | `VotingPanel` (default) | ✅ | **Read-only vote tally** section: round metadata grid + per-outcome share bars, highlighting the user's own vote. Casting happens on the dedicated vote screen (`/assertion/browse/[id]/vote`), not here. Props: `round, votingClosed, userVote`. |
| `dispute-action.tsx` ⭐ new | `DisputeAction` (default) | ✅ | Deadline-gated state-machine action panel covering every state: Asserted→**link to the dispute screen** (or finalize-as-TRUE when liveness expired), PendingLLM→mock council verdict buttons (`onSubmitLlmResolution`), AssertedLLM→**link to the dispute screen in challenge mode** (or finalize-LLM when window expired), PendingVote→open vote, Voting (live)→**big CTA linking to the vote screen** (or view-tally when already voted), Voting (closed)→finalize-vote, Resolved→settlement summary with final outcome. Rendered as a prominent centered framed card (dashed border, eyebrow, large title, `size="lg"` CTAs) — the page's single "what happens now" panel. Props: `assertion, userVote, onSubmitLlmResolution, onOpenVote, onFinalize` (dispute/challenge/vote are navigation, not callbacks). |
| `feed-header.tsx` | `Header` (default) | — | Sticky toolbar: sort select, stage select, quick-filter toggles, reset. Static option lists `SORT_FIELDS/STAGE_FILTERS/QUICK_FILTERS`. |
| `statement-section.tsx` | `StatementSection` | — | Make-form: collapsible statement textarea + char counter + warning. |
| `params-section.tsx` | `ParamsSection` | — | Make-form: dispute-window buttons (ui `Button` variants) + fixed bond + expiry. Matches sibling sections' style and animation (flex 0.3 easeInOut + 0.2 fade). |
| `evidence-section.tsx` | `EvidenceSection` | — | Make-form: auxiliary-data textarea. |
| `summary-section.tsx` | `SummarySection` | — | Make-form: review panel (statement + bond/window/expiry/aux-hash). |
| `section-header.tsx` | `SectionHeader` | — | Reusable collapsible header button (label, peek, shortcut hint, caret). |
| `warning.tsx` | `Warning` | — | Amber alert row, `role="alert"`. Props `{ msg }`. |
| `timeline.tsx` | `Timeline` | — | **Horizontal lifecycle timeline card** (dashed border + backdrop blur) built from optional assertion fields; final dot color by outcome; scrolls horizontally on narrow screens. The detail page pins it in-flow at the bottom of its fixed-height (`h-screen`, no page scroll) layout so it never overlaps content. Props `{ statement: AssertionAccount \| undefined }`. |

⭐ `voting-panel.tsx` and `dispute-action.tsx` are **new untracked files** (extracted
from the detail page). Both are complete UI that defer all real effects to callbacks.

## `activity/`

| File | Export | Client | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `activity-navigation.tsx` | `ActivityNavigation` (default) | ✅ | Sticky sub-nav for `/u/[address]`: Overview/Assertions/Disputes/Votes/Earnings tabs + truncated address with copy button. ⚠️ has a `// !TBD` clipboard TODO and a **duplicated address/copy block** (~lines 96–107). |

## `common/`

| File | Export | Client | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `container.tsx` | `Container` | — | Layout wrapper `mx-auto max-w-400`. |
| `corner-markers.tsx` | `CornerMarkers` | — | Decorative L-shaped corner brackets. |
| `logo.tsx` | `Logo` | — | Inline SVG logo w/ `style jsx`. ⚠️ appears **unused** (navbar uses `/img/logo.svg`). |
| `navbar.tsx` | `Navbar` (default) | ✅ | Fixed top nav: logo, ⌘K search, `NavbarAuth`, mobile hamburger, `SearchDialog`. |
| `mobile-navbar.tsx` | `NavbarMobile` (default) | ✅ | Animated mobile drawer with nav links + `NavbarAuth`. |
| `navbar-auth.tsx` | `NavbarAuth` | ✅ | Auth-state cluster (Sign in / Loading / Activity+address+Logout). SSR-safe via `useHydrated`. Real Privy wallet integration. |
| `search-dialog.tsx` | `SearchDialog` | ✅ | Bespoke modal (focus trap, Esc, backdrop) to search a profile by address; validates ETH/ENS/base58; routes to `/u/[address]`. |

## `landing/`

All Client, all static marketing content (no props, no data):

| File | Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `background.tsx` | `HeroBackground` | Dithered animated wave bg (`ditherwave`), lime `#bbf047` on `#141414`. |
| `hero.tsx` | `Hero` | Headline "Stake Your Truth", two CTAs → make / browse. |
| `process.tsx` | `Process` | "Three layers" — 3 cards w/ large inline isometric SVG illustrations (~800 lines). |
| `consumers.tsx` | `Consumer` | 4 integrator/persona cards. |
| `resolution-layers.tsx` | `ResolutionLayers` | 4 state cards (Asserted/AssertedLLM/PendingVote-Voting/Resolved), scroll-in animations. |
| `footer.tsx` | `Footer` | Three-column footer (brand / protocol links / follow) with dashed dividers, "OPAL" watermark, and a bottom bar with a pulsing Solana Devnet status chip. Server component. |

Non-component asset files also live here: `Group 14(4).svg`, `Group 9(1).svg`.

## Cross-cutting conventions

- **Client vs server:** interactive/animated/hook-using components declare `'use client'`;
  presentational sub-sections do not.
- **Variants:** `cva` only in `button.tsx` and `input-group.tsx`; elsewhere className
  strings + `cn()` (clsx + tailwind-merge).
- **Aesthetic:** uppercase + wide letter-spacing, dashed borders, monospace numerics,
  Phosphor icons, `motion` transitions, lime accent. Keep new components consistent.
- See [`status.md`](status.md) for the full list of known bugs/cleanup items referenced
  above with ⚠️.
