# Status: done / stubbed / known issues

Snapshot of what actually works vs. what's a placeholder. Keep this file updated as work
lands.

## ✅ Done (functional against mock data)

- **Complete mock assertion lifecycle** — every state now has an action screen and the
  full flow is walkable end-to-end in one session: create → dispute → post the LLM
  verdict (mock `submit_mock_llm_resolution`) → challenge → open vote → cast vote → finalize.
  Finalize screens exist for all three paths (undisputed / LLM / vote), plus a
  settlement summary on `Resolved`. Actions are deadline-gated via `isDeadlinePast`;
  user-triggered mock windows are short (5 min) so the flow stays demoable.
- **Client-side assertion store** (`lib/assertion-store.ts`) — `useSyncExternalStore`
  over the mock seed, plus **all mock protocol transitions** (`fileLlmDispute`,
  `submitLlmResolution`, `fileVoteDispute`, `openVote`, `castVote`,
  `finalizeAssertion`) — the single module to swap for real reads/txs. Created
  assertions and state transitions persist across navigation and show up in browse.
  Resets on hard refresh (a created assertion's URL 404s after refresh — expected
  until on-chain reads land).
- **Dedicated vote screen** (`/assertion/browse/[id]/vote`) — full-screen voting flow:
  large outcome cards with select → confirm bar, wallet-gated, recorded state with live
  tally, blocked notices when voting isn't open/has closed. The detail page's action
  card links here while voting is live; `voting-panel.tsx` is now a read-only tally.
- **Dedicated dispute screen** (`/assertion/browse/[id]/dispute`) — make-style
  accordion (Claim → Reason → Stake Summary) serving both dispute layers (first
  dispute on `Asserted`, LLM challenge on `AssertedLLM`), with blocked notices for
  ineligible states/expired windows. Detail-page actions link here instead of inline
  forms.
- **Create flow** — the make form now actually creates an `AssertionAccount` in the
  store (mock id, toy aux hash, liveness from the fixed 7-day window) and navigates to it.

- **Landing page** (`/`) — full marketing site: hero (dithered wave bg), 3-layer process
  section with custom SVG art, resolution-layers, consumers, footer.
- **Browse feed** (`/assertion/browse`) — filter (stage + quick filters), sort, animated
  grid of assertion cards, empty state.
- **Assertion detail** (`/assertion/browse/[id]`) — full detail view, live countdown,
  timeline, all section components render.
- **Make form** (`/assertion/make`) — complete multi-section accordion with validation +
  keyboard nav.
- **User dashboard** (`/u/[address]` + assertions/disputes/votes/earnings) — all tabs
  render derived views with filters + search.
- **Auth** — Privy social login + Solana embedded wallet; `useWallet()` context; SSR-safe
  auth UI; ⌘K profile search dialog with address validation.
- **Design system** — `ui/` primitives, tokens, dark mode.
- **Env validation** — `bun run check-env`.

## ⚠️ Stubbed / simulated (no real chain interaction)

The single biggest gap: **no on-chain integration exists at all** (no Anchor client, no
IDL, no program-ID/PDA derivation, no RPC account reads, no transaction submission).

Also note protocol-side placeholders that the UI should not over-promise on: LLM
resolution is a single trusted off-chain resolver (`submit_mock_llm_resolution` is the
only driver in tests; the 3-feed Switchboard council was removed per ADR-0002); voting is
a MagicBlock placeholder; `vote_disputer_reward_share_bps` / `voter_reward_share_bps`
exist but aren't distributed. See `../../../README.md` §"Current State" and `../../../docs/`.

## 🐞 Known bugs / cleanup items

- Unused `m` (motion) imports in a couple of landing/common files.

Fixed on `frontend/design-revamp` (see [`changelog.md`](changelog.md)): dashboard
sub-pages now read the client store with typed derivations (no `as any`); dashboard
earnings/reputation/disputes are role-scoped to the viewed address (asserter vs disputer);
the votes tab now reads real per-voter records (`VoteRecord[]` on each round), so its
status is `ACTIVE` until the assertion resolves then `SETTLED`, with `ALIGNED`/`MISALIGNED`
as a sub-filter and each voter's actual stake shown (no more constant `100%`);
`common/logo.tsx` and the unused local font files were removed; `globals.css` duplication
removed.

## 🔜 Not started

- Any read from the Anchor program (decode `AssertionAccount` etc.).
- Any transaction (create/dispute/challenge/open-vote/finalize).
- Wiring the Privy embedded wallet as a transaction signer.
- Real-time updates (account subscriptions) — RPC wss is configured but unused by app code.
- Aux-data storage/retrieval (the `auxiliaryUrl`/`auxiliaryHash` flow is illustrative).
